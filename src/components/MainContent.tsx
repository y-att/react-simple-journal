Normally, we count sheep to fall asleep - my problem is that I think sheep are fascinating animals, so this really doesn't help me. However, I think we can all agree that stones are boring (sorry, geologists) - so I've been counting stones instead!"

          I came across the Trolley Problem recently. I found it deeply
          troubling... why is it called 'the Trolley Problem' when it's actually
          about trains?
